# Contributing

Hi there ðŸ‘‹ We are excited that you want to contribute to this repository. By doing this you are helping people getting started and running with our infrastructure and that's cool ðŸ˜Ž.

Contributions to this project are [released](https://help.github.com/articles/github-terms-of-service/#6-contributions-under-repository-license) to the [project's license](../master/LICENSE).

Before merging a new sample, the following requirements need to be met:

- Should be as simple as is needed for the service.
- There are many programming languages and tools out there. Right now we don't have a page that allows for a really large number of workflows, so we do have to be a little choosy about what we accept. Less popular tools or languages might not be accepted.
- Should not send data to any 3rd party service except for the purposes of installing dependencies.
- Cannot use an Action that isn't in the `actions` organization.
- Cannot be to a paid service or product.

Thank you
